    <p>An about page reveals details about your life, working style, and experience. Clients want to know you’re a talented designer, and adding a description of your background and skills helps assure them that’s what you are. If they feel confident in your abilities, they’re more likely to reach out about a project.

        Include any social media page that provides more information about you or your online work, such as LinkedIn, Behance, or Dribbble to show potential clients more of your talents.</p>
